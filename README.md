# Emacs configuration

Global settings are in the init.el file, specific modes have their own files.

This will:

1. Check that all required packages are installed, installing them if not (usually).
1. Set up the global defaults (appearance, keyboard bindings etc).
1. Load each individual mode's init file.

That's it.  Added a couple of helper functions.

A constant work in progress :-)
