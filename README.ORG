* Emacs configuration
Global settings are in the init.el file, specific modes have their own files.

init.el will:

1. Check that all required packages for boot-strap are installed (basically, use-package), installing them if not (usually).
2. Load all settings from their individual files.
3. That's pretty much it.


- globals.el :: use for anything that has global use.
- helpers.el :: helper functions for config.
- random-functions.el :: as it says, stuff I occasionally use :-)
- theme.el :: not just the visual theme, but settings like hiding tool bars etc.
- dev-settings.el :: anything that effects the top-level development config.


A constant work in progress :-)

* Note on building emacs:
** Fedora
Install the following: ~autoconf texinfo gtk3-devel gnutls-devel giflib-devel libXpm-devel ncurses-devel librsvg2-devel systemd-devel libgccjit libgccjit-devel libtree-sitter libtree-sitter-devel~
** Arch
Install the following:
* Theme
Simplify all the things!  Use ~ewal~ to use the same theme as wot's as being used in the terminal.

* ToDo

** General
 - [ ] Move all projectile commands behind F12.

** Golang
- [X] Ensure using latest version of golang.
- [X] Copy old settings.
- [X] Update to use use-package for the basics.
- [X] Test.
- [ ] Add in the more complex stuff like popup menu etc.
- [ ] Test again.
- [X] Sadly wonder if I'll ever get to use an interesting language like this or Clojure professionally :-(
** Dart / Flutter
- [X] Nuke it all!
- [X] Get /just/ Dart up and running with a demo console app.
- [X] Get the bloody language server running.
- [X] Get Flutter up and running.
- [X] Demo app.
** Scheme
- [X] Reinstall Guile.
- [X] Setup Geiser (again); geiser-version currently returns @PACKAGE-STRING@...
** Org
- [ ] Get org-bullets working again
- [ ] Look into having a central agenda file.
- [ ] Learn how to use tags!  Seriously, it's been how long?
- [X] Turn of the key-binding C-TAB in org mode.  I never archive things, so would rather have it for switching windows.
** Elisp / Emacs
- [X] When running ansi-term, should source ~/.profile. (Doh, I just had shit bash config...)
- [X] Dig out old Emacs-notes org file, dust off and update with what I learnt on debugging elisp code.
- [ ] New wrapper function, that only runs config code if it can find the required command-line tool, i.e. goimports.  Should raise a warning that cannot find, and provide the required command to install it if it's a one-liner.
** Ruby
- [X] Get rid of all bloody versions other than default OSX one.
- [X] If that's not recent enough, install the latest /only/ - fecking RVM is an absolute pain, I don't actually need it for what I want to do.
- [ ] Setup enough for a nice REPL experience (don't worry about Rails, never going to use it - I hope).  At the least, should be able to evaluate functions/buffer in the Ruby process.
** Global
- [-] Abbrev mode
  - [X] Turn on.....
  - [ ] Remind self what this is cos I've forgotten sine I wrote this.....
  - [ ] Endlessly add new abbreviations
- [ ] Setup [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_templates.html][YaSnippet]]
  - [ ] Setup some basic config templates, i.e. gsk -> (glob-set-key (kbd "$1") '$2)
  - [ ] Create some Golang templates
  - [ ] Spend far too long playing around with this feature
- [ ] Update helper-run-if-found to use executable-find
