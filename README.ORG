* Emacs configuration
Global settings are in the init.el file, specific modes have their own files.

init.el will:

1. Check that all required packages for boot-strap are installed (basically, diminish), installing them if not (usually).
2. Load all settings from their individual files.
3. That's pretty much it.

- globals.el :: use for anything that has global use.
- lsip/helpers.el :: helper functions, mostly for config.
- lisp/random-functions.el :: as it says, stuff I occasionally use :-)
- theme.el :: not just the visual theme, but settings like hiding tool bars etc.
- dev-settings.el :: anything that effects the top-level development config.

A constant work in progress :-)

* Theme
Simplify all the things!  I'm using ~ewal~ to use the same theme as wot's as being used in the terminal.  That said, here's the theme that I occasionally work on, a modified ~tango-2~ theme, which in itself is a mod of the ~tango~ theme:
